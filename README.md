1) The app is designed based on UIKit.
2) The app supports only portrait orientation.
3) This app is designed to ensure that the user interface is appropriately displayed on both iPads and iPhones.
4) The app uses AlertController and CollectionView.
5) To calculate tips, a collection with customized cells was used. A single customized cell is reused throughout the entire collection.
6) The calculate button displays the result using an alert after performing the calculation.
7) The tip calculation logic includes error handling for various potential issues, such as,for example, ensuring that the number of people cannot be zero.
8) The app's screen image and icon were generated using AI.

**Future plans on implementing additional features / addressing any existing issues** :
1) Include additional information about tipping culture in various countries using REST API.
2) Although the hideKeyboard feature works as intended after editing the text field, there is still an issue with the text field input related to a valid session ID.
   While the issue does not crash the app, it still needs to be addressed.
3) If feasible, modify the calculation logic to obtain the necessary values for computation without directly addressing the view elements.
   
The list of future plans is not finite and may be subject to adjustment.
